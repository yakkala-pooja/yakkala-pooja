# 👋 Hi, I’m Pooja Yakkala (@yakkala-pooja)

🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing an **MS in Artificial Intelligence** at **Rochester Institute of Technology** (Class of 2026), with a strong foundation in AI and Data Science from my BTech at SR Gudlavalleru Engineering College.

I’m passionate about:
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI
- Computer Vision & NLP (especially medical imaging and VQA)
- Building robust, interpretable AI systems
- Cross-domain and few-shot learning for satellite data
- MLOps and scalable AI pipelines

Currently learning:
- Advanced AI robustness techniques
- Scalable model deployment using Vertex AI
- Multimodal learning for real-world tasks

Looking to collaborate on:
- Research or open-source projects in ML/CV/NLP
- Projects applying AI in healthcare or environmental monitoring
- Exploratory work in neuro-symbolic AI or multimodal transformers

## Notable Projects

**Stress-Testing CNNs Using Causal Concept Subversion**  
*Robust AI | Grad-CAM | CLIP | PyTorch*  
Tested model fragility by injecting semantic OOD patches into causal regions, revealing 40% drop in ResNet-18 accuracy and proposing a new fragility metric (CFI).

**Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning for Satellite Imagery**  
*Contrastive Learning | ViT | CD-FSL*  
Built a domain adaptation and contrastive learning pipeline that minimized domain shift in urban vs. rural satellite image classification.

**Multimodal Transformer for Heart Failure Risk Prediction**  
*SHAP | Attention | Tabular + Time-Series*  
Integrated time-series vitals and static features to outperform traditional models with an F1-score boost from 0.70 to 0.88.

**Search Desk – A Big Data Search Engine**  
*Flask | OCR | NLP | BERT*  
Created a cross-format document search engine with OCR and BERT-based summarization, reducing query response time by 75%.
